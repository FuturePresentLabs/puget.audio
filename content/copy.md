### Intro: The Puget Classics Bundle

**The pedals that started it all. Now in your DAW.**

Four legendary overdrive and distortion circuits, meticulously modeled using our proprietary Wave Digital Filter engine. Unlike impulse responses or curve-fitting approximations, these plugins simulate the actual physics of analog electronics — the way components interact, clip, and respond to your playing dynamics.

From the smooth mid-boost of a green screamer to the aggressive bite of a high-gain distortion, the Classics Bundle covers the essential gain stages that every guitarist needs. Each model runs at native sample rates with ultra-low latency, giving you the feel of analog hardware with the convenience of software.

**$49–$79** — Individual plugins or complete bundle

## Features Section

### Feature 1: Wave Digital Filter Technology
**Not emulation. Simulation.**

Most digital effects use impulse responses or black-box curve fitting to approximate analog behavior. We do something different. Our Wave Digital Filter (WDF) engine models the actual electrical components — resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors — as they interact in real time. The result is a level of authenticity that responds to your playing like the real thing.

### Feature 2: Circuit-Accurate Nonlinearity
**Feel the difference.**

Analog circuits behave differently depending on how hard you hit them. WDF modeling captures this dynamic behavior — the subtle compression, harmonic saturation, and touch-sensitive breakup that makes analog gear feel alive. Whether you're rolling back your guitar's volume or digging in for a solo, the response is authentically analog.

### Feature 3: Seattle Manufacturing Heritage
**From our workshop to your studio.**

Puget Audio is headquartered in a real machine shop in Seattle's industrial district. Our hardware pedals are CNC-machined on-site. Our software is developed by engineers who understand both code and solder. This isn't Silicon Valley vaporware — it's craftsman-quality tools built by people who use them.

### Feature 4: Open Technology Foundation
**Powered by PedalKernel.**

Every Puget Audio product is built on the PedalKernel WDF engine — the same open-source core trusted by thousands of developers and musicians worldwide. When you buy Puget Audio, you're supporting the continued development of open audio technology. Learn more at [pedalkernel.dev](https://pedalkernel.dev).

### Why WDF Matters

**The Problem with Traditional Modeling**

Most digital audio effects fall into three categories:

1. **Impulse Responses (IRs)** — Capture a snapshot of a circuit's response, but can't adapt to playing dynamics or control changes.

2. **Curve Fitting** — Mathematical approximations of frequency response that ignore the complex nonlinear behavior of real components.

3. **Hybrid Methods** — Combine modeling with samples, introducing latency and artifacts while still missing the feel of true analog.

**The WDF Difference**

Wave Digital Filter theory, developed at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and refined over decades of academic research, provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling analog circuits. Instead of approximating behavior, WDFs model the underlying physics:

- **Kirchhoff's Laws** — Conservation of current and voltage at every node
- **Component Models** — Realistic nonlinear behavior for diodes, transistors, and tubes
- **Topological Fidelity** — The actual circuit schematic, transformed into the digital domain
- **Real-Time Performance** — Optimized algorithms that run at native sample rates

**The Result**

Plugins that respond to your playing like the circuits they're modeled after. Touch-sensitive dynamics. Authentic harmonic content. The feel of analog, without the maintenance.

## FAQ Section

### Q: What's the difference between PedalKernel Free and Puget Audio plugins?

**A:** PedalKernel Free provides open-source access to our WDF engine and community-built pedal models. Puget Audio plugins are premium, professionally designed models with higher circuit complexity, more nonlinear elements, and demanding DSP requirements. Revenue from Puget Audio supports continued development of the open-source PedalKernel project.

### Q: Do these plugins work with my DAW?

**A:** All Puget Audio plugins are distributed as VST3 format, compatible with major DAWs including Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, and FL Studio. macOS and Windows are both supported.

### Q: What's the latency like?

**A:** Our WDF engine is optimized for real-time performance. Most plugins introduce less than 64 samples of latency — low enough for comfortable monitoring while tracking.

### Q: Can I use these for commercial productions?

**A:** Yes. Every Puget Audio license includes unlimited commercial use. Use them on records, films, games, and broadcasts. No attribution required.

### Q: Do you offer educational discounts?

**A:** Yes. Students and educators receive 30% off with valid verification. Contact us at education@puget.audio.

### Q: What's your refund policy?

**A:** We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with your purchase for any reason, contact support@puget.audio for a full refund.

## About/Story Section

### Our Story

**Hardware. Software. Seattle.**

Puget Audio began in a machine shop in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood. We were building boutique guitar pedals — real hardware, CNC-machined enclosures, hand-soldered circuits — when we realized that the same Wave Digital Filter technology could power both our analog designs and digital plugins.

The result is a unique ecosystem: open-source tools that power premium products. Every Puget Audio plugin you buy supports continued development of the PedalKernel WDF engine, which remains free and open for the community.

We're not a Silicon Valley startup chasing valuations. We're craftspeople, engineers, and musicians building tools we want to use. Welcome to the workshop.
