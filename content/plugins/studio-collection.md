## The five tools that built modern recording. Modeled from the circuit up.

The Pultec shapes the tone. The 1176 catches the transients. The LA-2A levels the dynamics. The 670 glues the bus. The 1073 does everything in between.

An engineer can mix an entire record with these five tools. Generations of them have.

## What's included

| Plugin | Models | Type |
|--------|--------|------|
| [Puget Passive EQ](/plugins/passive-eq/) | Pultec EQP-1A | Equalizer |
| [Puget Opto Compressor](/plugins/opto-compressor/) | Teletronix LA-2A | Compressor |
| [Puget FET Limiter](/plugins/fet-limiter/) | UREI 1176LN | Limiter |
| [Puget Variable-Mu](/plugins/variable-mu/) | Fairchild 670 | Compressor/Limiter |
| [Puget Channel](/plugins/channel/) | Neve 1073 | Preamp/EQ |

## $699 — Save $296

That's roughly $140 per plugin vs. $199 individually. Five perpetual licenses, all formats (VST3/AU/AAX), macOS and Windows.

No subscriptions. No iLok. No dongles. Buy once, use forever.

## Why WDF matters for a full signal chain

Each plugin in the collection uses the same PedalKernel WDF engine. They share the same mathematical rigor and the same approach to circuit modeling. When you chain them together, you get the same kind of interaction you'd get chaining the real hardware — because each plugin is modeling real components with real impedance characteristics.

The 1073's output transformer drives the 1176's input transformer. The LA-2A's tube stages color the signal before the 670's push-pull amplifier. These interactions aren't programmed — they emerge from the physics.
