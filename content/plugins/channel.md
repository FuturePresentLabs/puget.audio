The most recognized preamp in recording history. The 1073 is all transformers and inductors — transformer-coupled Class A discrete preamp, inductor-based 3-band EQ with high-pass filter.

## Every component that matters

Every component that gives it that "Neve sound" — the Marinair transformers, the hand-wound inductors, the tantalum capacitors — is a WDF element in our model. Nothing is approximated. Nothing is left out.

## Real inductors, not filter coefficients

The inductor-based EQ is classic WDF territory. Real inductors have frequency-dependent losses, saturation characteristics, and Q factors that interact with the source impedance. We don't approximate these — we model the inductor as a physical component with its real-world parameters.

The result is an EQ that responds to level. Push it harder and the inductors saturate slightly — the same nonlinear behavior that makes the hardware version a tracking staple.

- **Transformer-coupled Class A discrete preamp**
- **3-band inductor EQ + HPF**
- **Marinair-style transformer I/O** modeled as WDF two-ports
- **Inductor losses and saturation** captured by physical modeling

## Use it on

Everything. The 1073 is the channel strip that built modern recording. Vocals, drums, guitars, bass — it works on all of them because the circuit was designed to work on all of them.

**$199 — Perpetual license. No iLok. No dongle.**
