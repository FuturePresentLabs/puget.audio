title: "Puget Audio"
description: "Serious tools for serious musicians. Built in Seattle."

We build professional audio tools for musicians who care about how things work.

Our approach is simple: model the physics, not the sound. Every resistor, capacitor, and transistor — simulated in real time using Wave Digital Filter technology.

The result? Software and hardware that respond to your playing like the real thing. Because under the hood, they follow the same physical laws.

**Based in Seattle. Built in a machine shop. Rooted in open technology.**

## What We Do

### Circuit-Accurate Modeling

Most digital audio approximates analog behavior. We simulate it. Our Wave Digital Filter engine models actual component physics — Kirchhoff's laws, energy relationships, nonlinear dynamics — in real time.

### Seattle Craftsmanship

Our hardware is machined and assembled in-house at our Georgetown workshop. Our software is developed by engineers who understand both code and solder. This isn't Silicon Valley vaporware — it's craftsman-quality tools built by people who use them.

### Open Foundation

Every product is built on the open-source PedalKernel engine. The approach is transparent, the math is rigorous, and the community validates the science. When you buy Puget Audio, you support continued open audio development.

## Coming Soon

We're launching our first products in 2026. VST3 plugins for producers and engineers. Hardware pedals for guitarists and bassists. All built on the same circuit-simulation foundation.
