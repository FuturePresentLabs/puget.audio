## Studio-Grade Audio Tools

We build two kinds of products: software plugins that run in your DAW, and hardware pedals you can bolt to your board. Both share the same DNA — circuit-accurate models built on our Wave Digital Filter engine.

### VST3 Plugins

Professional-grade effect emulations for producers, engineers, and guitarists. Each plugin models the actual physics of analog circuits — not impulse responses, not curve fitting, but real component simulation.

**Coming soon.**

### Hardware Pedals

Hand-assembled effects pedals machined in our Seattle workshop. Original designs that solve real problems for working musicians. Every circuit exists as a validated software model before the first enclosure gets milled.

**Coming soon.**
