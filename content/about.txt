Puget Audio builds professional audio tools for musicians who care about how things work.

We don't approximate analog. We simulate it.

Every product starts with the same question: what would this circuit do if we modeled every component exactly? The resistors, capacitors, transistors — all interacting in real time, just like the hardware.

The result is software that responds to your playing like analog gear. Because under the hood, it is analog. Just transformed into mathematics.

Based in Seattle. Rooted in open technology.

Serious tools for serious musicians.
