      <h3>Circuit-Accurate Modeling</h3>
      <p>Most digital audio approximates analog behavior. We simulate it. Our Wave Digital Filter engine models actual component physics — Kirchhoff's laws, energy relationships, nonlinear dynamics — in real time.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Our hardware is machined and assembled in-house at our Belltown workshop. Our software is developed by engineers who understand both code and solder. Craftsman-quality tools built by people who use them.</p>

      <h3>Open Foundation</h3>
      <p>Every product is built on the open-source <a href="https://pedalkernel.com">PedalKernel</a> engine. The approach is transparent, the math is rigorous, and the community validates the science. When you buy Puget Audio, you support open audio development.</p>
