<p>We build two kinds of products: software plugins that run in your DAW, and hardware pedals you can bolt to your board. Both share the same DNA — circuit-accurate models built on our Wave Digital Filter engine.</p>
<h3 id="vst3-plugins">VST3 Plugins</h3>
<p>Professional-grade effect emulations for producers, engineers, and guitarists. Each plugin models the actual physics of analog circuits — not impulse responses, not curve fitting, but real component simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon.</strong></p>
<h3 id="hardware-pedals">Hardware Pedals</h3>
<p>Hand-assembled effects pedals machined in our Seattle workshop. Original designs that solve real problems for working musicians. Every circuit exists as a validated software model before the first enclosure gets milled.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon.</strong></p>
